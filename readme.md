### HOW THE GAME WORKS

The aim of the game is to fire a line through the moving blocks in as few clicks as possible. You fire a line by clicking on the white box that runs down the right hand side of the game window. You lose a life for every block left on the screen after your click.

### CHALLENGES

The main challenge I encountered during the creation of the game was the collision between the redline and the blocks. It occasionally would not register a hit seemingly at random, however after rewriting the function several times I finally managed to to hit upon a better collision solution.

### IMPROVEMENTS

I plan to add more style to the individual levels, such as a background and block types unique to the level. I'd also like to scale the difficulty better, so the first levels are easier to complete but the later levels considerably more difficult.
